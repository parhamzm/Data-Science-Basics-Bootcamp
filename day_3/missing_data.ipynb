The first argument is a positional argument that specifies the dataframe we want to merge with, known as the `right` dataframe. (The dataframe you're calling the method on is always the `left` dataframe.) The `how` argument specifies which dataframe's keys we'll use to match to, and the `on` argument lets us define the columns to use as keys.\n",
